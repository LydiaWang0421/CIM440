  This project is designed to educate children and their parents about playground rules, and the games can be played at the playground. The target audience of this project is the kids under ten years old and their parents. It will be displayed at public parks, kindergartens, and elementary schools.
  There is a wood sign that shows the general playground rules. There are several playground equipments which the children can click and see the basic rules of how to play. Also, there are some special functions, some of them provide videos that will give the children a more clear view, and some of them offer a funny game for the children to play on the screen. For younger kids, they can hover over the animals and see the description of the animals.
